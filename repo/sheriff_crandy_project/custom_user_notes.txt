***

If you want to use custom user model, 
DO NOT RUN python manage.py makemigrations/migrate until 
you have created your custom user model, 
otherwise Django will revert to its default User Model. 
Changing from Django's default user model to a 
custom user model is possible, but unsupported 
and prone to many errors. Do this first before anything 
else if that's what you want for your app

***

in root dir:

- activate env
(linux) . env/bin/activate
- create your user app
python manage.py startapp your_custom_user_app_name
- go to your main project's settings.py file and in the INSTALLED_APPS dictionary add your user app:
'your_custom_user_app_name'
see src for model/view/urls setup. Modify as desired.

- When you are satisfied with your user, run:
python manage.py makemigrations
- and then:
python manage.py migrate
